## üï∞Ô∏è A Legacy Reimagined: The Story

For over 25 years, my brother-in-law has dedicated his life to the art of watchmaking, building a beloved local business founded on trust, expertise, and a deep passion for horology.  
This project is more than just code; it is a mission to carry that quarter-century of dedication into the digital world.

Our goal is to build an online experience that mirrors the quality, elegance, and personal touch of the physical store, making these beautiful timepieces accessible to a new generation of enthusiasts while honoring the tradition that started it all.

## üë®‚Äçüíª A Developer's Journey

As a self-taught software developer, this project represents a significant milestone in my learning path.  
Moving beyond tutorials and isolated exercises, **BV-Beni Watches** is my first full-scale, real-world application, built from the ground up.

It's a practical opportunity to tackle the entire full-stack development lifecycle: from initial planning and UI/UX design to frontend development with React, TypeScript y Next.js, backend API creation, and finally, deployment.  
Every feature implemented and every problem solved is a direct contribution to my growing expertise and a testament to the power of hands-on learning.
