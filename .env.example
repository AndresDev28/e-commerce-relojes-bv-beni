# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES - RELOJES BV BENI
# ============================================================
# [PAY-22] Environment Configuration per Environment
# Ticket: AND-31
#
# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Copy this file to .env.local for development
# 2. Fill in your actual values (get from team/dashboard)
# 3. NEVER commit .env.local to version control
# 4. For production, set these in your hosting platform
# ============================================================

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# NODE ENVIRONMENT (Set automatically by Next.js)
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# This is set automatically, but you can override for testing:
# - development: npm run dev
# - production: npm run build && npm start
# - test: npm test
# NODE_ENV=development

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# STRAPI CMS API
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# URL of your Strapi backend API
#
# Development: http://localhost:1337
# Production: Your deployed Strapi URL (must be HTTPS)
#
# Example:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API_URL=https://api.relojes-bv-beni.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API_URL=http://localhost:1337

# STRIPE PAYMENT GATEWAY
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# [PAY-22] Environment-specific Stripe keys
# Get your keys from: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
#
# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Use different keys for each environment!
# ============================================================

# PUBLIC KEY (Safe to expose in browser)
# This key is embedded in your frontend bundle
#
# Development/Test: Starts with "pk_test_" followed by 40+ characters
# Production: Starts with "pk_live_" followed by 40+ characters
#
# The application will automatically validate:
# - Development must use pk_test_* keys
# - Production must use pk_live_* keys
# - Format must be correct
#
# Get test keys: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys
# Get live keys: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_publishable_key_here

# SECRET KEY (NEVER expose in browser - server-side only)
# This key has full access to your Stripe account
#
# Development/Test: Starts with "sk_test_" followed by 40+ characters
# Production: Starts with "sk_live_" followed by 40+ characters
#
# ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY:
# - This key should NEVER have the NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix
# - Never log this key
# - Never commit this key to version control
# - Only used in API routes (server-side)
# - Rotate immediately if accidentally exposed
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key_here

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# ENVIRONMENT-SPECIFIC CHECKLIST
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Before deploying to each environment, verify:
#
# ✅ DEVELOPMENT:
#   - NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY starts with pk_test_
#   - STRIPE_SECRET_KEY starts with sk_test_
#   - NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API_URL points to localhost or dev server
#   - All test data is clearly marked
#
# ✅ STAGING (if you have one):
#   - NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY starts with pk_test_
#   - STRIPE_SECRET_KEY starts with sk_test_
#   - NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API_URL points to staging server (HTTPS)
#   - Test with production-like data
#
# ✅ PRODUCTION:
#   - NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY starts with pk_live_
#   - STRIPE_SECRET_KEY starts with sk_live_
#   - NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API_URL points to production server (HTTPS)
#   - All URLs use HTTPS
#   - Keys are different from development/staging
#   - Stripe webhook endpoints configured
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# SECURITY BEST PRACTICES
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. ✅ Use test keys (pk_test_*, sk_test_*) in development
# 2. ✅ Use live keys (pk_live_*, sk_live_*) in production only
# 3. ✅ Never commit .env.local to version control
# 4. ✅ Never expose secret keys (sk_*) to the browser
# 5. ✅ Never use NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix for secret keys
# 6. ✅ Use different keys for each environment
# 7. ✅ Rotate keys immediately if accidentally exposed
# 8. ✅ Enable HTTPS in production (required for payments)
# 9. ✅ Set up proper CORS for your Strapi API
# 10. ✅ Monitor Stripe dashboard for suspicious activity
#
